# Gender Determination Program
Identifying the gender of a name... We will use the heuristic that the last few characters in a name is its defining characteristic. For example, if the name ends with "la", it's most likely a female name, such as "Angela" or "Layla". On the other hand, if the name ends with "im", it's most likely a male name, such as "Tim" or "Jim". Using this program we will be able to predict the gender of a name and compare the accuracy of classifiers that use varying numbers of ending letters to determine the gender of a name.
